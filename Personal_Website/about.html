            <h1>The Maestra of Programming</h1>
            <p>Maestra...? Maestra. It wasn't until 2019 when I discovered my passion for programming. 
                My initial career choice was unrelated to computer science, yet the skills required to be successful
                in both my initial field and the computer science field are in harmony. 
                <br>
                Growing up, I had always been heavily involved in music, so it made sense to me to eventually pursue it 
                as a career. It is important to note that my mother works in IT, and I had also been exposed to her 
                world to a great degree growing up. Upon graduating from Ball State University in 2018, I assumed a high school 
                band and orchestra director position. AP music theory is one of many courses that I taught, and through it, 
                I quickly discovered my profound interest in analysis and composition. My passiong for music theory paired with my 
                exposure and growing interest in the computer science field eventually led me to combining the two. 
                Fortunately, my analytical and problem-solving skills as a director are universal. In any spare time outside 
                of my job, I devoted myself to learning programming languages and related content. 
                This brings us to the present. Now, I study full time and am working toward gaining real-world experience. 
                <br>
                Pursuing a career in a field that is ever-evolving, much like the music field, means I can continue to be a 
                life-long learner. To intertwine abstraction with concrete information to create something
                in front of your own eyes is like a director audiating music and bringing it to life... Every composition
                and project is unique, and there are endless approaches to putting the pieces together. I am eager to 
                continue growing alongside technology, and this is only the beginning...
