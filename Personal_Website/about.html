            <h1>The Maestra of Programming</h1>
            <p>Maestra...? Maestra. It wasn't until 2019 when I discovered a new-found love for programming. 
                My initial career was unrelated to web, yet surprisingly similar to programming. 
                My mother works in the IT field, so it makes sense that I would inevitably be drawn to something similar. 
                I had always been intrigued by her work and how she makes sense of the GIBERISH she types
                herself. My ambitious nature and love for learning propelled me into 
                her world, and I had no idea where to begin. I most definately took the longest road instead
                of the shortest path...but hey, I've loved every minute of it. Making my own discoveries futher ignited 
                my curiosity, and each learned skill brought about so much joy that it became addicting. To see something 
                imagined turned into something concrete right in front of my eyes was like hearing the music come to life 
                whenever I taught a band, an orchestra, or music theory. Fortunately, I have been able to translated my problem-solving skills as a director
                to my problem-solving skills as a programming, and that is another unique discovery...the skills both careers demand are oddly parallel. 
                I constantly had a feeling in my stomach and a voice in the back of my mind that forced me to pursue front-end development 
                as a career, so here we are! This is only the beginning...
